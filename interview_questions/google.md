    Given a sparse bit array A of size M stored in a database. The database provides an API query(L,R) which returns 1 if there is at least one bit equal to one in A[L..R] and 0 otherwise.

    You want to find all the 1 bits in a reasonable number of queries. E.g. for array 01100000001, positions of 1 bits are {1, 2, 10}.

    Return the array of all the positions of 1's.

    > use Binary search, Do recursively and divide and conquer.

1. Given a and b in int return their diff in string, a and b could be large values.
