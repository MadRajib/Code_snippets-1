### Trees 
| TERM                   | Meaning |
|------------------------|---------|
| ancestor               | A node’s parent, its parent’s parent, and so on to the root are the node’s ancestors. |
| binary tree            | A tree with degree 2. |
| branch                 | Connects nodes in a tree. |
| child                  | A child node is connected to its parent in the tree. Normally a child is drawn below its parent. |
| complete tree          | A tree in which every level is completely full, except possibly the bottom level, where all the nodes are pushed as far to the left as possible. |
| degree                 | For a node, the number of children the node has. For a tree, the maximum degree of any of its nodes. |
| depth                  | Level. |
| descendant             | A node’s children, their children, and so on are the node’s descendants. |
| external node          | A leaf node. |
| first (or least) common ancestor | For any two nodes, the node that is the ancestor of both nodes that is closest to the nodes. |
| full tree              | A tree in which every node has either zero children or as many children as the tree’s degree. |
| height                 | For a node, the length of the longest path from the node downward through the tree to a leaf node. For a tree, this is the same as the root’s height. |
| internal node          | A tree node that has at least one child. |
| leaf node              | A tree node with no children. |
| level                  | A tree node’s level is the distance between it and the root node. |
| node                   | An object that holds data in a tree. Connected to other nodes by branches. |
| ordered tree           | A tree in which the ordering of each node’s children matters. |
| parent                 | A parent node is connected to its child nodes by branches. Every node except the root has exactly one parent. Normally the parent is drawn above its children. |
| perfect tree           | A full tree where all the leaves are at the same level. |
| root                   | The unique node at the top of the tree that has no parent. |
| sibling                | Two nodes in a tree that have the same parent are siblings. |
| subtree                | A node and all its descendants in a tree. |
